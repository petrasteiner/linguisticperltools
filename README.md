# linguisticperltools
This repository will finally comprise some of the tools and pipelines I created mainly during the period of 2014-2018, some of them revised. 
I used the Dipper tokenizer which I modified, the Treetagger for lemmatization, SMOR for morphological analyses. I modified part of SMOR code too or asked H. Schmidt for changes.

The linguistic data were a Wikipedia corpus and the MLD corpus which were freely supplied from IDS (Leibniz Institut für Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim). 

Lists of Named Entities: revised and augmented(!) versions from SMOR plus extracted and augmented in regard to the linguistic data. Not freely available.

Quick start:
    Install Perl 5.14 or later version for Linux or Cygwin
    Put the Input files into the same folder as the respective program.
    Start the program.
    Check out which libraries are missing, install them and repeat starting the program.
